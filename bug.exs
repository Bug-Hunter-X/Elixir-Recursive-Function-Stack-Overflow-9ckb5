The following Elixir code attempts to recursively traverse a potentially deeply nested list, but it lacks a base case for stopping the recursion, leading to a stack overflow error.

```elixir
list = [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]

defmodule NestedList do
  def traverse(list) do
    Enum.each(list, fn element ->
      if is_list(element) do
        traverse(element)
      else
        IO.puts(element)
      end
    end)
  end
end

NestedList.traverse(list)
```
